# MultiSeat Requirements

## Operating System

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Windows 11** | Build 26100+ (24H2) strongly recommended |
| **Windows 10** | Build 19041+ (2004) minimum — some features may be limited |
| **Windows Server** | Not officially tested |
| **Architecture** | x64 only |

> **A seat does not get its own virtual display on any Windows version.** Windows does not let a
> virtual display created in the console session join an RDP session's topology: the monitor is
> created, attaches to the *console* desktop, and the seat enumerates zero SudoVDA entries. Seats
> therefore capture the RDP session surface. This is normal architecture, not a broken install —
> measured and reported in [issue #15](https://github.com/vibesoftwarecoder/MultiSeat/issues/15).
>
> Two consequences worth knowing before you file a bug:
>
> - **HDR does not work for a seat today** (`EnableHdr` has no effect) — but not for the reason
>   this used to give. Measured on a live seat: the RDP surface *advertises* advanced colour
>   (`advancedColorSupported = true`) while it sits inactive at 8 bits per channel. So "the RDP
>   surface has no EDID" was wrong; the capability is advertised. The blocker is that the VidPN
>   **source** mode stays SDR. Nonary demonstrated HDR working inside a terminal session by
>   forcing Windows to rebuild that source mode
>   ([issue #15](https://github.com/vibesoftwarecoder/MultiSeat/issues/15)); MultiSeat does not do
>   that yet. Check any host with
>   `GET /api/seats/{id}/diagnostics/advanced-color`.
> - **Seat resolution** is the RDP session's, which only `mstsc` sets at connect time — it cannot be
>   changed from inside the session afterwards.

## Required Software

### PowerShell 7+

The prerequisites and install scripts require **PowerShell 7** (pwsh). Windows PowerShell 5 is not supported.

Install via winget:
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell
```
Or download from: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases

After installing, open **PowerShell 7** (search "pwsh" in Start) and run all MultiSeat scripts from there.

---

### .NET Runtime

| Component | Version | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **.NET 9 Runtime** | 9.0+ | Required to run MultiSeat.Service |
| **.NET 9 ASP.NET Core Runtime** | 9.0+ | Included with the full runtime |

Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0

---

### Apollo (Sunshine Fork)

Apollo is a fork of Sunshine with support for running multiple instances simultaneously — one per seat.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Apollo** | v0.4.6+ |
| **Install path** | `C:\Program Files\ApolloVibe\sunshine.exe` (configurable; separate from any standalone `C:\Program Files\Apollo`) |
| **Notes** | Do NOT use upstream Sunshine — it does not support multi-instance. MultiSeat installs and manages its own Apollo, so it coexists with a standalone Apollo on the same host. |

Download: https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo/releases

---

### Virtual Display Driver — SudoVDA

Each seat needs its own virtual display for the streaming encoder to capture. SudoVDA is bundled with Apollo and managed automatically — Apollo creates and destroys one virtual display per instance.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **SudoVDA** (bundled with Apollo) | Installed automatically with Apollo |
| **Minimum displays** | One virtual display per seat (Apollo manages these) |
| **Notes** | The display must be connected to an Active RDP session — do not disconnect mstsc |

---

### Headless Operation — Persistent Virtual Display

If the host machine has **no physical monitor** connected, Windows may not expose a GPU output for the GPU driver or remote access tools (AnyDesk, RDP) to use before any seat is provisioned.

Install a persistent virtual display that appears at boot, independent of any streaming client:

```powershell
.\prerequisites\install-virtual-display.ps1
```

This script downloads and installs the [Virtual Display Driver by itsmikethetech](https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver), a persistent IddCx virtual monitor that works on Windows 10/11 x64. A reboot may be required after installation.

Alternatively, download it manually: https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases

> **Note:** This is separate from SudoVDA. SudoVDA (Apollo's driver) creates per-seat virtual displays only while Apollo is running. The persistent virtual display fills the gap when no seat is active, so the machine always has at least one display for remote access.

---

### Virtual Audio Devices — VB-CABLE + VoiceMeeter Potato

**Only under `MultiSeat:AudioMode = SharedHost`.** The default, `PerSession`, gives every seat its own RDP "Remote Audio" endpoint and needs **neither** of these; `install-prerequisites.ps1` skips them unless you pass `-AudioMode SharedHost`. `SharedHost` remains the only mode with a microphone path.

Under `SharedHost`, each seat needs its own virtual audio device so audio is routed to the correct Moonlight client. MultiSeat uses VB-CABLE basic (seat 0) and VoiceMeeter Potato (seats 1–3). Both are free and auto-downloaded by the prerequisites script.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **VB-CABLE** (basic) | v4.5+ — provides 1 virtual audio device (seat 0) |
| **VoiceMeeter Potato** | v3.1+ — provides 3 virtual audio devices (seats 1–3) |
| **VoiceMeeter running** | Must be running for audio routing to work — auto-starts at boot after install |

Downloads:
- VB-CABLE: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
- VoiceMeeter Potato: https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm

---

### HidHide

HidHide hides physical controllers from the host so that controller input is only visible to the correct seat's session.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **HidHide** | v1.5.230+ |
| **Install path** | `C:\Program Files\Nefarius Software Solutions\HidHide\x64\HidHideCLI.exe` |

Download: https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide/releases

---

### ViGEmBus

ViGEmBus provides the virtual Xbox controller driver that MultiSeat uses to forward controller input to each seat's session.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **ViGEmBus** | v1.22.0+ |

Download: https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases

---

### RDPWrap (Multi-Session RDP)

Windows Home and Pro editions normally allow only one concurrent RDP session. RDPWrap patches `termsrv.dll` to allow multiple simultaneous sessions.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **TermWrap** (default) | v0.6+ — finds its offsets by disassembling `termsrv.dll`, so no per-build ini and no breakage on Windows updates. Install with `prerequisites\install-termwrap.ps1`. |
| **RDPWrap** (alternative) | v1.6.2+ — offsets come from `rdpwrap.ini`, keyed by exact `termsrv.dll` build |
| **Required for** | Windows 10/11 Home and Pro |
| **Not needed for** | Windows Server (multi-session is built in) |
| **Notes** | Must be kept updated when Windows updates `termsrv.dll` |

Download: https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap

---

### Moonlight Client (on player devices)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Moonlight** | Latest stable release |
| **Platforms** | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, tvOS, Raspberry Pi |

Download: https://moonlight-stream.org/

---

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 8-core | 12+ cores (2+ cores per seat) |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | 32+ GB (4+ GB per seat) |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA GTX 1060 or AMD RX 580 | NVIDIA RTX 3060+ or AMD RX 6700+ |
| **GPU VRAM** | 6 GB | 8+ GB |
| **Storage** | SSD with 50 GB free | NVMe SSD |
| **Network** | 100 Mbps LAN | 1 Gbps LAN (for multiple seats) |

> **GPU Note:** Hardware video encoding (NVENC/AMF) is required for acceptable performance. Each active seat uses one encoder instance. Check your GPU's concurrent encoder limits:
> - NVIDIA consumer GPUs (GTX/RTX): typically 3–5 concurrent NVENC sessions (varies by driver)
> - NVIDIA professional GPUs (Quadro/RTX A-series): unlimited concurrent sessions
> - AMD GPUs: typically 1–2 concurrent AMF sessions on consumer cards

---

## Windows Configuration

### Remote Desktop

Remote Desktop must be enabled:

```
Settings → System → Remote Desktop → Enable Remote Desktop: On
```

Or via PowerShell:
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -Name fDenyTSConnections -Value 0
Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
```

### User Account Control (UAC)

The MultiSeat service runs as SYSTEM and launches processes as user accounts. For admin accounts used as streaming seats, UAC must not prevent the service from obtaining elevated tokens. Standard (non-admin) accounts work without UAC concerns.

### Windows Defender / Antivirus

MultiSeat.InputHook.dll uses low-level Windows hooks for keyboard/mouse isolation. Some antivirus products may flag this as suspicious. Add the MultiSeat install directory to your AV exclusions if needed.

---

## Per-Seat Requirements

For each concurrent streaming seat:

| Resource | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Windows local account | One per seat (created/managed by MultiSeat, or link an existing account) |
| Virtual display | One SudoVDA display per seat |
| Virtual audio device | One per seat: VB-CABLE (seat 0) or VoiceMeeter virtual input (seats 1–3) |
| TCP/UDP ports | 30-port block per seat (default: 48100–48129, 48130–48159, ...) |
| Apollo config directory | Created automatically under `C:\ProgramData\MultiSeat\apollo\` |
| Emulator netplay port | One per seat: `PortBase + 13` (48113, 48143, ...); seats netplay over `127.0.0.1` |

### Shared game library

MultiSeat creates a shared library at `C:\MultiSeatGames` (configurable) at first start, with
`SteamLibrary` + `ROMs` subfolders granted to `BUILTIN\Users`. Add the `SteamLibrary` folder in
each seat's Steam (Settings → Storage) so a game an owning account already installed isn't
re-downloaded; put ROMs in `ROMs`. Disable via `EnableSharedGameLibrary` / point at a data drive
via `SharedGameLibraryDir`.

---

## Network / Firewall

MultiSeat automatically creates Windows Firewall rules for each seat's ports. If you use a third-party firewall, allow the following per seat:

| Port Range | Protocol | Use |
|------------|----------|-----|
| PortBase + 0 | TCP | Apollo HTTPS (Moonlight pairing) |
| PortBase + 1 | TCP | Apollo HTTP |
| PortBase + 2 | TCP/UDP | RTP video |
| PortBase + 3 | TCP/UDP | RTP audio |
| PortBase + 4 | TCP/UDP | Control channel |
| 9550 | TCP | MultiSeat dashboard (local only recommended) |

Default `PortBase` = 48100. Each additional seat adds 30 to the base (Seat 1 = 48130, Seat 2 = 48160, etc.). The base sits above a stock Apollo's block so MultiSeat coexists with a standalone Apollo.

---

## Known Limitations

- **NVIDIA consumer GPU concurrent sessions:** GTX/RTX consumer cards have a driver-enforced limit of 3–5 simultaneous NVENC sessions. Use an NVENC session limiter patcher or a professional GPU to exceed this.
- **Virtual display disconnect:** If the mstsc session managing a seat's virtual display is disconnected, Apollo loses access to the display and streaming fails. MultiSeat keeps this session active automatically — do not manually disconnect it.
- **Windows updates:** Windows updates that replace `termsrv.dll` will break RDPWrap until it is updated. Check the RDPWrap GitHub for updated `rdpwrap.ini` patches.
- **Single GPU:** Multi-GPU configurations are not tested. All seats should use the same GPU for encoding.
